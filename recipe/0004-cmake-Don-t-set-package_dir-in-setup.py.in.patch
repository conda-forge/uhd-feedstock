Subject: [PATCH] cmake: Don't set package_dir in setup.py.in.

Since the setup.py.in gets configured to the CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR
and the Python files get copied there as well, there is no need to set
package_dir.

This also fixes a bug where the path that used to be set for package_dir
fails on Windows (the path is converted to a native format by
setuptools, but it doesn't account for absolute paths with a drive
specified and so fails to do this properly).
